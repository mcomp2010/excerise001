List Comprehensions

You are given three integers X, Y and Z denoting the dimensions of a
Cuboid. You have to print a list of all possible coordinates on the
three dimensional grid, such that at any point the sum Xi + Yi + Zi is
not equal to N. If X = 2, then possible values of Xi can be 0, 1 and 2.
The same applies to Y and Z.

Input Format

Four integers X, Y, Z and N in four different lines.

Output Format

You have to print the list, in increasing order.

Sample Input

1 1 1 2

Sample Output

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]

Nested List (DONE)

There is a classroom of ‘n’ students and you are given their names and
marks in physics. Store them in a nested list and print out names of
student who got the second lowest marks in physics.

NOTE: If there are more than one student getting same marks, make sure
you print the names of all students in alphabetical order, in different
lines.

Input Format

Integer N followed by alternating sequence of N strings and N numbers.

Output Format

Name of student

Sample Input

5 Harry 37.21 Berry 37.21 Tina 37.2 Akriti 41 Harsh 39

Sample Output

Berry Harry

Finding the percentage

There is a record of ‘n’ students, each record having name of student,
percent marks obtained in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. Marks can be
floating values. The user enters an integer ‘n’ followed by names and
marks for the ‘n’ students. You are required to save the record in a
dictionary data type. The user then enters name of a student and you are
required to print the average percentage marks obtained by that student,
correct to two decimal places.

Input Format

Integer N followed by name and marks for N students.

Output Format

Average percentage of marks obtained

Constraints 2 <= N <= 10 0 <= Marks <= 100

Sample Input

3 Krishna 67 68 69 Arjun 70 98 63 Malika 52 56 60 Malika

Sample Output

56.00
